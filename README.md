# OpenTable front-end test
========================

## Overview

This repo is my attempt at OpenTable's front-end test. The instruction for completing this test are located in the instructions directory. I have used a jQuery CDN.

## To Run

To run this project, start a localhost in the root directory.

## Time to Complete

This exercise took approximately 3 and a half hours.

## Notes

I have made use of the solution to allow a user to deselect radio buttons from [12Robots.com](http://www.12robots.com/index.cfm/2009/6/9/Unselecting-Radio-Buttons-with-jQuery) maintained by Jason Dean. This code block is noted where it is used.
